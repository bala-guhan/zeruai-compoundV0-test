You are provided with raw, transaction-level data from the Compound V2 protocol. 
Each record corresponds to a wallet interacting with the protocol through actions 
such as deposit, borrow, repay, withdraw, and liquidation.

Your task is to develop a machine learning model that assigns a credit score between 
0 and 100 to each wallet, based solely on historical transaction behavior. Higher scores indicate 
reliable and responsible usage; lower scores reflect risky, bot-like, or exploitative behavior.

This is a self-driven, end-to-end modeling task. You are not provided with labels, predefined features, or a target column. 
Your responsibilities include:

Defining criteria for "good" and "bad" wallet behavior
Engineering features from raw transaction logs
Choosing and justifying your modeling approach (e.g., clustering, rule-based scoring, supervised learning)
Designing a credit scoring system that reflects behavioral quality and protocol health
